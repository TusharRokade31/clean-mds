<p>All payments made on My Divine Stays are processed through <strong>secure, trusted payment gateways</strong> that follow industry-standard security protocols. This ensures that sensitive payment details such as card numbers, UPI IDs, and bank information are never stored on our servers.</p>
<p>Every transaction is <strong>encrypted </strong>and protected using advanced security measures, so your payment information remains private and safe at all times.</p>
<p>Once a booking is completed, pilgrims receive a <strong>clear booking confirmation</strong>, and dharamshalas receive accurate booking details for verification. This maintains transparency on both sides and avoids confusion or misuse.</p>
<p>My Divine Stays acts only as a <strong>technology platform</strong> that facilitates bookings and payments. We do not collect or misuse any personal or financial data beyond what is required to complete the booking securely.</p>
